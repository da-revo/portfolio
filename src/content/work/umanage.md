I worked with my classmate at the time, [Rahul Sathanapalli (currently, Senior Software Engineer @ Bloomberg)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/skvrahul/), to build this app for Tonsetech.

Created a Flutter iOS App that fetched the data and locations of a fleet of
GPS-connected vehicles from a backend via REST API calls and displayed it on
a map with additional features like displaying the history and paths taken by
vehicles, mobile ads, street views of nearby locations, etc
