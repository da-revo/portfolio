- Grew marketfeed (a fast-growing Y-Combinator backed fintech startup) to $16million+ assets under management as one of the early Software Engineers at the company.
- Designed and implemented multiple new features and services to the GCP backend using various technologies like serverless functions, realtime databases, REST APIs, webhooks, message queues, etc.
- Worked directly under the Engineering Lead and participated in code reviews; reviewing code of engineers both junior and senior to me.
- Followed best practices of clean code, dependency injection, domain driven design (DDD), test driven development (TDD), etc
- Drove the adoption of Go, Protocol Buffers, gRPC and gRPC-Gateway to automate large portions of the backend software development lifecycle by creating type-safe language-independent APIs with client library generation, automatic versioning, OpenAPI spec and documentation generation, etc
